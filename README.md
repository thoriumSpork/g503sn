Overview
This purpose of this application is to allow visitors to the g503.com site to register known information about their World War 2 military jeep in the master database and search for information about other jeeps that have been included.

For the time being the intention is to use this file as a simple Software Design Document until it makes sense to separate that information.

The G503 main website is based on WordPress so this version will be developed as a WordPress Plugin.
